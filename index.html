            text based layouts are really only good for things that are flowing
            in the same direction that text does so inline elements and text
            going across the page, block elements going down the page

        </section>

        <section>
          using normal flow, make all the element display: inline-block (or
          inline-flex, inline-grid, etc) - Pros: white space is maintained
          between elements - Cons: layout is controlled by each individual
          element, so it's all over the place Probably best in situations that
          are very text like (eg label + input maybe?) I personally never use
          this option
        </section>

        <section>
          using grid works well when you know exactly how many things there are
          _can_ work when you don't know how many things there are
          (grid-auto-flow: column) but this usage is unusual
        </section>

        <section>
          using flex - the simplest way to achieve this - probably my go-to
        </section>

          exception: horizontal scrolling. can this work with flex? or only
          grid? or only normal flow?

        <section>
          flex pros: - easier when we don't know how many elements there are, or
          there are a lot of elements grid pros: - all the layout is in a single
          place, so it's easier to understand complex layouts (could go either
          way)

        <section>(yes) grid. with autofit/fill</section>

          flex => grid simple => complex browser has more control => developer
          has more control closer to leaf => further from leaf (nest flex in
          grid more than grid in flex)
        </section>

        <section>
          in conclusion YES we still need flex but it's not the go-to that it
          once was if you start nesting flex containers, you probably want grid
